# device-camera-web
Turn mobile phones into IP cameras that can be used in for instance OBS.

Althought I have my doubts about this project I am trying to create a web app where you can:
* Log inn with your mobile device
* Allow access to camera and microphone
* And use the device basicly as an IP camera
* While on your desktop, you can connect to this stream and add it as a browser source to OBS
